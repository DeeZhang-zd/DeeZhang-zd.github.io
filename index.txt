About me

I'm a graduate student specializing in Computer Science at Oregon State University. With strong communication skills, team spirit, and problem-solving abilities, I am passionate and dedicated to my field of study. Outside of academics, I have a zest for life, embracing adventures like traveling, road trips, hiking, and swimming

In terms of professional interests, I lean towards full-stack development but remain open to exploring various directions within the tech industry. I possess a robust learning ability, which I believe equips me to take on diverse challenges in technology. My journey in full-stack development is complemented by several personal projects that allowed me to hone my skills and apply tools and technologies such as Python, HTML, CSS, JavaScript, Node.JS, MongoDB, Mongoose, Docker, Passport.js, and Auth0...

A believer in continuous learning, I am currently engaged in expanding my knowledge base through Angular/React online courses from Udemy during my spare time. Embracing every opportunity to learn, adapt, and grow is central to my approach in navigating the dynamic landscape of Computer Science
